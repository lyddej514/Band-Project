<p>The Black Violin group is a formally known hip-hop duo from Florida. This classically trained duo consists of musician Kevin Sylvester aka as Kev Marcus and Wilner Baptiste aka Wil B. Kev Marcus plays the violin while Wil B plays the viola. The duo met in a performing arts program in Fort Lauderdale and formed their group after attending some Universities together. Sylvester and Marcus usually incorporate their string music into hip-hop songs which became popular in local clubs. Baptiste and Sylvester said that while classical and hip-hop music seems worlds apart, both are meant to bring people together. Black Violin had quite the ride on it's musical endeavors they were asked by the manager of Alicia Keys to perform with the singer in the Billboard Awards in 2004. The dynamic duo also had several offers to go on tours and work with several other musicians such as Linkin Park, Wu-Tang Clan, Lil Wayne, Alessia Cara and a few others. They played as many as 200 shows a year and released two albums before releasing their Stereotypes album in 2016, which debuted number one on the Billboards Classical Crossover Albums chart and reached number four on the Top R&B Albums Chart. The thing I like the most about the group and the reason I chose them is not only do they play amazing music, but they are a positive and uplifting inspiration for our youth. Sylvester and Baptiste spend a great amount of time collaborating with music schools and programs which empowers young musicians and provides them with programs that foster creativity and innovation. </p>
